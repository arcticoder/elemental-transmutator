PHOTONUCLEAR GOLD PRODUCTION - 3-MONTH ROADMAP
==============================================

Generated: 2025-06-19 21:14
Strategy: Outsourced micro-experiments
Total Budget: $300.00 CAD

MONTH 1: DIGITAL OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------------
Phase: Digital Optimization
Budget: $0.00
Goal: Complete Monte Carlo simulation and lock in optimal recipe

Key Activities:
  Week 1: Complete Monte Carlo digital twin
  Week 2: Implement Bayesian optimizer
  Week 3: Recipe optimization campaign
  Week 4: Lock in one-shot recipe

Success Criteria: Recipe with ≥ 0.01 mg Au predicted yield

MONTH 2: FIRST MICRO-EXPERIMENT
-------------------------------
Phase: First Micro-Experiment
Budget: $52.83
Goal: Execute first outsourced irradiation + analysis cycle

Key Activities:
  Week 1: Sample preparation and vendor coordination
  Week 2: Gamma irradiation at vendor facility
  Week 3: ICP-MS analysis
  Week 4: Data analysis and model calibration

Success Criteria: Detectable gold measurement with <25% uncertainty

MONTH 3: CALIBRATION & VALIDATION
---------------------------------
Phase: Calibration & Validation
Budget: $85.00
Goal: Calibrate model and validate process reproducibility

Key Activities:
  Week 1: Model calibration with real data
  Week 2: Optimized recipe generation
  Week 3: Second micro-experiment (if budget allows)
  Week 4: Business case development

BUDGET BREAKDOWN:
- Month 1 (Digital): $0.00
- Month 2 (First Exp): $52.83
- Month 3 (Validation): $85.00
- Safety Reserve: $162.17

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
By Month 3 end, you will have:
✓ Real experimental data on gold yield
✓ Calibrated Monte Carlo model
✓ Economic viability assessment
✓ Decision point for scale-up or pivot

NEXT STEPS:
- If yield ≥ 0.02 mg Au: Plan scale-up to 10g batches
- If yield 0.005-0.02 mg Au: Optimize process parameters
- If yield < 0.005 mg Au: Consider alternative approaches

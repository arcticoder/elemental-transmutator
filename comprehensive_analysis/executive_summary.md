**Analysis Date:** 2025-06-19 23:01:58

**Analysis Duration:** 2.0 seconds

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment:** ‚ùå NOT VIABLE - No pathways meet economic thresholds

**Recommended Action:** DO NOT OUTSOURCE - Fundamental limitations identified

## Key Findings

- **Total Configurations Tested:** 16,875
- **GO Decisions:** 0 (0.0%)
- **NO-GO Decisions:** 16875

## Next Steps

1. Explore alternative transmutation approaches
1. Consider different target elements (Pt, Ir)
1. Investigate laser-driven acceleration
1. Re-evaluate economic assumptions

## Risk Factors

- Cross-sections may be overestimated
- Facility enhancement factors uncertain
- Competing processes not fully modeled

## Optimization Opportunities

- Optimize dose and dose rate for maximum yield/cost ratio
- Optimize dose and dose rate for maximum yield/cost ratio
- Focus on beam energy optimization around GDR peaks (13-16 MeV)
- Optimize target geometry and density for interaction efficiency
- Investigate pulsed beam advantages for nonlinear enhancement
